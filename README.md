In this Git thing, we're only going to have Robot.java in the main branch.
This so we can just copy the good, working, code out when needed. I would
recommend making a shortcut on your desktop to your robot code (which should be something along
the line of || Robot\src\main\java\frc\robot || on your hard drive depending on where you make it
and what you call it). Then, whenenever you want to upload code to your branch, then open this folder and then
copy Robot.java into the folder where you keep Git stuff. Keep your own stuff in your personal branch. Only merge your branch back to main if the code is good, and it will also have to be approved
by the Codemasters.
